# Chapter Scaffold Generator

## Overview

This skill generates complete chapter scaffolds for the Agentic Coding Book, including:
- **Chapter directory** with individual section files (one file per section)
- **Section-level YAML frontmatter** with auto-suggested metadata (tags, related chapters, requirements)
- **Section structure** tailored to the part type (Foundations, Playbook, Patterns, Example)
- **Placeholder guidance** to accelerate content drafting

**Key Benefits**:
- **Section-level files**: Each section is a separate file (~5-10 KB) for easier management
- **Batch mode**: Scaffold all 50 chapters in ~2 hours
- **Context efficient**: ~6.5k tokens per scaffold, ~12.5k for 5 scaffolds
- **Auto-inference**: Part/chapter/section numbers from file paths
- **Smart suggestions**: Tags, related chapters, and requirements based on content area
- **Quality foundation**: Ensures consistent structure across all chapters
- **Parallel work**: Multiple sections can be drafted simultaneously without merge conflicts

## Critical Principle: Customize, Don't Template

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This skill is NOT about applying generic templates. It's about creating thoughtful, chapter-specific scaffolds that reflect what each chapter actually needs to teach.

**Bad scaffolding**: Generic section names like `[Concept 1]`, `[Step 1]`, `[Principle Name]`
**Good scaffolding**: Specific section names like `From Code Executor to Product Orchestrator`, `The Five Competency Domains`, `Writing Requirements with EARS`

See Example 1b in EXAMPLES.md for a detailed comparison.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Create new chapter scaffolds before content drafting
- Batch-generate scaffolds for multiple chapters at once
- Establish consistent frontmatter and section structure
- Prepare chapters for the draft-section skill (content writing phase)

**Prerequisites**:
- `design.md` (Section 3.1 for frontmatter schema)
- `brief.md` (for tag/topic suggestions)
- `requirements.md` (for requirement traceability)
- Chapter file path(s) to scaffold

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Context

Before scaffolding, read the necessary context files:
- [ ] Read `/home/testa/agentic-coding-book/planning/design.md` (Section 3.1)
- [ ] Read `/home/testa/agentic-coding-book/planning/brief.md`
- [ ] Read `/home/testa/agentic-coding-book/planning/requirements.md`

**Why**: These files contain the frontmatter schema, topic areas for tag suggestions, and requirements for traceability.

### Step 2: Parse File Path(s)

For each chapter to scaffold, extract metadata from the directory path:

**Path Pattern**: `book/<part-directory>/<chapter-directory>/`

**Examples**:
- `book/part1-foundations/01-renaissance-developer/` → Part 1, Chapter 1
- `book/part2-playbook/03-brainstorm-to-brief/` → Part 2, Chapter 3
- `book/part3-patterns-tools/architecture/01-clean-boundaries/` → Part 3 (subdirectory)
- `book/part4-example/10-launch-day/` → Part 4, Chapter 10

**Auto-inference**:
- **Part number**: Extract from directory name (`part1` → 1, `part2` → 2, etc.)
- **Chapter number**: Extract from directory name prefix (`01-` → 1, `03-` → 3, etc.)
- **Chapter title**: Derive from directory name (e.g., `renaissance-developer` → "The Renaissance Developer")

### Step 3: Generate Frontmatter for Each Section

Create complete YAML frontmatter for each section file following this schema:

```yaml
---
title: "Section Title"                   # Section-specific title
chapter_title: "Chapter Title"           # Chapter context (from directory name)
part: 1                                  # Auto-inferred from directory
chapter: 3                               # Auto-inferred from directory name
section: 1                               # Section number (1-based)
version: "0.1"                           # Start at 0.1 (draft)
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"                       # Current date
status: "draft"                          # Always start as "draft"
author: "Brian Childress"                # Default author
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]          # Auto-suggested based on content area
related: []                              # Auto-suggested related sections (optional)
requirements: []                         # Auto-suggested requirements (optional)
abstract: |
  [Placeholder: 1-2 sentence summary of this section's content
  for search and navigation purposes. To be written during drafting.]
---
```

**Section-specific fields**:
- `title`: Section-specific title (e.g., "Introduction: The Specialist's Dilemma")
- `chapter_title`: The chapter title for context (e.g., "The Renaissance Developer")
- `section`: Integer section number (1, 2, 3, etc.) for ordering within chapter

#### Tag Suggestion Strategy

**Part 1 (Foundations)**: `["foundations", "mindset", "principles"]` + topic-specific
- Ch 1: `["renaissance-developer", "mindset", "foundations"]`
- Ch 2: `["agentic-coding", "definitions", "foundations"]`
- Ch 3: `["architecture", "principles", "foundations"]`
- Ch 4: `["interfaces", "design", "foundations"]`
- Ch 5: `["bottlenecks", "workflow", "foundations"]`

**Part 2 (Playbook)**: `["playbook", "workflow", "process"]` + phase-specific
- Requirements/design chapters: `["specifications", "ears", "openapi"]`
- Testing chapters: `["testing", "validation", "quality"]`
- Deployment chapters: `["deployment", "environments", "production"]`

**Part 3 (Patterns & Tools)**: `["patterns", "reference"]` + category-specific
- Architecture: `["architecture", "patterns", "design"]`
- Specifications: `["specifications", "ears", "openapi", "asyncapi"]`
- Testing: `["testing", "patterns", "validation"]`
- Toolchain: `["tools", "json-schema", "mcp", "skills"]`

**Part 4 (Example)**: `["example", "narrative", "walkthrough"]` + phase-specific
- Early chapters: `["mvp", "planning", "example"]`
- Middle chapters: `["implementation", "iteration", "example"]`
- Late chapters: `["production", "launch", "example"]`

#### Related Chapters Suggestion Strategy

Suggest 2-4 related chapters based on:
- **Sequential flow**: Previous/next chapters in the workflow
- **Cross-references**: Related patterns or concepts from other parts
- **Prerequisites**: Foundational concepts needed to understand this chapter

**Examples**:
- `part2-playbook/04-requirements-writing.md` → related to `part3-patterns-tools/specifications/ears-notation.md`
- `part4-example/05-implementing-mvp.md` → related to `part2-playbook/06-implementation-planning.md`
- `part1-foundations/03-architecture-principles.md` → related to `part3-patterns-tools/architecture/` chapters

#### Requirements Suggestion Strategy

Suggest relevant requirements from `requirements.md` based on chapter topic:
- **Content requirements**: REQ-C001-C050 (what the book teaches)
- **Structural requirements**: REQ-S001-S011 (organization, navigation)
- **Technical requirements**: REQ-T001-T021 (tooling, authoring, deployment)
- **Quality requirements**: REQ-Q001-Q013 (accuracy, clarity, examples)
- **Non-functional requirements**: REQ-N001-N025 (accessibility, performance)
- **Publishing requirements**: REQ-P001-P012 (license, distribution, feedback)

**Examples**:
- Architecture chapter → `REQ-C011, REQ-C012, REQ-C013` (architecture patterns)
- Testing chapter → `REQ-C019, REQ-C020, REQ-C021` (testing strategies)
- EARS notation chapter → `REQ-C015, REQ-C016` (specification writing)

### Step 4: Determine Section Structure and Create Files

Select the appropriate section structure for the part, then **customize it** based on the specific chapter topic.

**CRITICAL**: Don't just use generic templates. Think about what this specific chapter needs to teach based on:
- The chapter title (e.g., "Renaissance Developer" vs "Architecture Principles")
- The topic area from brief.md
- The requirements this chapter addresses

**Process**:
1. Select base section structure for the part (see templates below)
2. Replace generic section names with specific, meaningful names
3. For each section, create a separate `.md` file in the chapter directory
4. Each file gets its own frontmatter with appropriate section number
5. Customize placeholder guidance to reflect actual section content

**File naming convention**: `<section-number>-<section-slug>.md`
- Section numbers: 01, 02, 03, ... (zero-padded for sorting)
- Section slug: kebab-case version of section title

**Example files**:
- `01-introduction.md` - Introduction section
- `02-renaissance-developer-model.md` - The Renaissance Developer Model section
- `03-what-changes-what-doesnt.md` - What Changes, What Doesn't section
- `09-summary.md` - Summary section
- `10-further-reading.md` - Further Reading section

---

**Customization Guide by Chapter Type**:

**For mindset/concept chapters** (e.g., "Renaissance Developer", "What is Agentic Coding"):
- Replace "Key Concepts" subsections with actual concepts from the chapter topic
- Add specific examples that illustrate the mindset shift
- Include comparison sections (old way vs new way, before vs after)

**For principles chapters** (e.g., "Architecture Principles", "Design Patterns"):
- List the actual principles as main sections, not generic "Principle 1, 2, 3"
- For each principle: explanation, why it matters, how to apply it, what breaks if you ignore it
- Include decision trees or when-to-use guidance

**For workflow chapters** (e.g., "Brainstorm to Brief", "Requirements Writing"):
- Name the actual steps in the workflow, not "Step 1, Step 2"
- Include specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and tools for each step
- Add "Working with Claude Code" section with actual prompts for that phase

**For pattern chapters** (e.g., "EARS Notation", "Clean Boundaries"):
- Use the pattern name in section headings
- Include real code examples, not placeholder syntax
- Add specific "When to Use" vs "When NOT to Use" scenarios

**For example chapters** (Part 4):
- Use actual project decisions, not generic placeholders
- Include real prompts used with Claude
- Show actual code snippets and their evolution through iteration

### Step 5: Create Chapter Directory

Create the chapter directory if it doesn't exist:
- Use `Bash` tool with `mkdir -p` command
- Path format: `book/<part-dir>/<chapter-dir>/`

Example:
```bash
mkdir -p book/part1-foundations/01-renaissance-developer/
```

### Step 6: Write Section Files

For each section in the chapter structure:

1. **Generate section frontmatter** (Step 3 schema) with:
   - `section`: Integer section number (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - `title`: Section-specific title
   - `chapter_title`: Chapter title for context

2. **Generate section content** from the appropriate template part

3. **Combine frontmatter + content**:
```markdown
---
[YAML frontmatter with section metadata]
---

[Section content with placeholders]
```

4. **Write file** with naming convention `<NN>-<section-slug>.md`:
   - Use `Write` tool with path: `book/<part-dir>/<chapter-dir>/<NN>-<section-slug>.md`
   - Confirm successful creation

5. **Repeat** for all sections in the chapter

### Step 7: Batch Mode (Optional)

When scaffolding multiple chapters:
1. Process chapters sequentially
2. Keep context under 25k tokens total
3. Group by part for efficiency (shared context)
4. Report progress after each chapter scaffold
5. For each chapter: create directory + all section files

**Batch output**:
```
Scaffolded Part 1, Chapter 1:
✓ Created directory: book/part1-foundations/01-renaissance-developer/
✓ 01-introduction.md
✓ 02-renaissance-developer-model.md
✓ 03-what-changes-what-doesnt.md
✓ 04-good-enough-principle.md
✓ 05-mindset-shift.md
✓ 06-practical-example.md
✓ 07-common-pitfalls.md
✓ 08-why-this-matters.md

- [ ] Filename follows `NN-section-slug.md` format
- [ ] Section numbers are sequential starting from 01
- [ ] Placeholders are clear and actionable
- [ ] No lorem ipsum or meaningless filler
- [ ] Mermaid diagram placeholders where appropriate

### File Quality Validation
- [ ] Files written to correct paths
- [ ] Markdown syntax is valid
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is properly formatted
- [ ] No trailing whitespace or formatting issues

## Best Practices

1. **Auto-infer aggressively**: Reduce manual input by deriving metadata from file paths
2. **Smart defaults**: Use sensible defaults (version 0.1, status "draft", current date)
3. **Placeholder clarity**: Make placeholders actionable guides, not generic filler
4. **Batch efficiency**: Process multiple chapters in one session when possible
5. **Consistent formatting**: Maintain identical structure across chapters of same part
6. **Leave room for refinement**: Scaffolds are starting points, not final content

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Unclear chapter number from filename | Default to sequence order, flag for manual review |
| Unknown appropriate tags | Use part-level defaults, add TODO comment |
| No obvious related chapters | Leave empty array, populate during drafting |
| Ambiguous requirements mapping | Suggest broad category requirements, refine later |
| Part number ambiguous (subdirectories) | Extract from top-level directory only |

## Example Invocations

### Single Chapter

**User**: "Scaffold book/part1-foundations/01-renaissance-developer/"

**Expected Output**:
- Chapter directory created
- 8-10 section files created with proper frontmatter
- Each section has placeholder content following Part 1 template

### Batch (Part)

**User**: "Scaffold all Part 1 chapters"

**Expected Output**:
- 5 chapter directories created (01-05)
- Each with 8-10 section files
- Consistent structure across all chapters in the part

### Batch (Multiple Parts)

**User**: "Scaffold all chapters for the book"

**Expected Output**:
- All ~50 chapter directories created across 4 parts
- Each with appropriate section files for that part type
- Frontmatter auto-generated with part-specific conventions

## Integration with Other Skills

**Upstream** (before scaffolding):
- Review `design.md`, `brief.md`, `requirements.md` for context

**Downstream** (after scaffolding):
- **draft-section skill**: Draft individual section files (simplified workflow)
- **mermaid-diagrams skill**: Generate diagrams referenced in section placeholders
- Manual editing and refinement of section files

**Parallel**:
- CI/CD validation scripts (frontmatter, links, markdown lint)

## Performance Targets

- **Single chapter scaffold** (10 sections): < 3 minutes, ~8k tokens
- **Batch (5 chapters)**: < 15 minutes, ~20k tokens
- **Full book (50 chapters, ~500 sections)**: < 3 hours, multiple batches

## Output Format

For each scaffolded chapter, confirm:

```
✓ Scaffolded: book/part1-foundations/01-renaissance-developer/
  - Part: 1, Chapter: 1
  - Chapter Title: "The Renaissance Developer"
  - Sections created: 10 files (01-introduction.md through 10-further-reading.md)
  - Tags: ["renaissance-developer", "mindset", "foundations"]
  - Section template: Part 1 (First Principles Teaching)
  - Status: Ready for content drafting with draft-section skill
```

## Notes

- This skill focuses on **structure**, not **content**
- Content drafting is handled by the separate `draft-section` skill
- Scaffolds serve as blueprints and placeholders
- User should review and refine scaffolds before drafting content
- Scaffolds ensure consistency across the entire book
