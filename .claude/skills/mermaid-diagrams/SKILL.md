# Mermaid Diagram Generator

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive support for creating, validating, and refining Mermaid diagrams. Use it whenever you need to visualize workflows, architectures, processes, or relationships.

## Supported Diagram Types

- **Flowcharts**: Decision flows, process steps, algorithm visualization
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Interaction flows, API calls, multi-party conversations
- **Class Diagrams**: Object-oriented design, relationships, inheritance
- **State Diagrams**: State machines, lifecycle processes
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**: Database schemas, data relationships
- **Gantt Charts**: Project timelines, dependencies
- **Pie Charts**: Distribution and composition
- **Graph/Network Diagrams**: Node relationships and connections
- **Component Diagrams**: System architecture and component relationships
- **User Journey**: User flow and experience mapping

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Request
- Identify what needs to be visualized
- Determine the most appropriate diagram type
- Consider the level of detail needed (high-level vs detailed)

### Step 2: Choose Detail Level
- **High-level**: Overview with major components only (3-7 nodes)
- **Medium**: Standard detail with key relationships (8-15 nodes)
- **Detailed**: Comprehensive with all components (15+ nodes)
- **Minimal**: Simplest possible representation (2-5 nodes)

### Step 3: Design the Diagram
- Create clear, well-formatted Mermaid syntax
- Use meaningful node IDs and labels
- Organize logically (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
- Add styling where appropriate

### Step 4: Validate Syntax
Before presenting the diagram, verify:
- [ ] All brackets/braces are balanced
- [ ] Node IDs are unique and valid
- [ ] All connections reference existing nodes
- [ ] Labels are properly quoted if they contain special characters
- [ ] Syntax matches the chosen diagram type
- [ ] No trailing spaces or invalid characters

### Step 5: Present the Diagram
- Show the complete Mermaid code block
- Add a brief description of what it represents
- Mention any design decisions or alternatives considered

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing ANY diagram:

1. **Syntax Correctness**
   - [ ] No unclosed brackets, braces, or quotes
   - [ ] Valid operators for diagram type
   - [ ] Proper indentation and formatting

2. **Node Definitions**
   - [ ] All nodes are defined before being referenced
   - [ ] Node IDs follow naming conventions (alphanumeric, -, _)
   - [ ] Labels are clear and descriptive

3. **Connections**
   - [ ] All connections use valid syntax
   - [ ] All referenced nodes exist
   - [ ] Arrow directions are correct

4. **Readability**
   - [ ] Not overcrowded (consider splitting if >20 nodes)
   - [ ] Logical flow (usually top-to-bottom or left-to-right)
   - [ ] Consistent styling

5. **Purpose**
   - [ ] Diagram serves its intended purpose
   - [ ] Appropriate detail level
   - [ ] Clear and unambiguous

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful IDs**: Instead of `node1`, use `userAuth` or `dbQuery`
2. **Keep labels concise**: Use short, clear descriptions
3. **Maintain consistent styling**: Use similar formatting throughout
4. **Group related elements**: Organize logically related components
5. **Add context**: Include title or description above the diagram
6. **Test before finalizing**: Mentally render or use Mermaid Live Editor

## Common Syntax Patterns

### Flowchart Node Types
```
id[Rectangle]
id([Rounded])
id[(Database)]
id((Circle))
id{Diamond/Decision}
id{{Hexagon}}
id[/Parallelogram/]
id[\Parallelogram\]
id[/Trapezoid\]
id[\Trapezoid/]
```

### Flowchart Arrows
```
A --> B          Simple arrow
A -->|text| B    Arrow with label
A -.-> B         Dotted arrow
A ==> B          Thick arrow
A <--> B         Bidirectional
```

### Sequence Diagram Messages
```
A->>B: Sync message
A-->>B: Async response
A--)B: Async message
A--xB: Message to destroyed participant
activate/deactivate for lifelines
```

### State Diagram Syntax
```
[*] --> State1
State1 --> State2: transition
State2 --> [*]
```

## Quick Reference: Diagram Type Selection

| Need to Show | Use This Diagram Type |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Process flow, algorithm | Flowchart |
| API interactions, message passing | Sequence Diagram |
| Object relationships, inheritance | Class Diagram |
| State transitions, lifecycle | State Diagram |
| Database schema | ERD |
| Project timeline | Gantt Chart |
| Data distribution | Pie Chart |
| System components | Component Diagram |
| User experience flow | User Journey |

## Examples

For comprehensive examples, see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).
For advanced validation patterns, see [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Diagram not rendering | Check for unclosed brackets or quotes |
| Connection errors | Verify node IDs match exactly (case-sensitive) |
| Syntax errors | Validate against diagram type syntax |
| Overcrowded diagram | Break into multiple diagrams or increase detail level |
| Unclear visualization | Add descriptive labels or choose different diagram type |

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Document system architecture
- Visualize workflow or process
- Show data relationships
- Illustrate API interactions
- Create project timelines
- Display decision trees
- Show state transitions
- Map user journeys
- Explain complex concepts visually

## Output Format

Always provide:
1. Brief description of what the diagram shows
2. The complete Mermaid code block
3. Confirmation of syntax validation
4. Optional: Alternative approaches or improvements
