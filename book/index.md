**Transform any product idea into a production-ready MVP in 6 weeks.**

This book is the definitive playbook for building software products in the age of AI. It democratizes product development, enabling anyone—from vibecoders to CTOs—to build and ship software using agentic coding.

## About This Book

Rather than teaching programming, this book teaches *product building* in an era where AI agents handle the mechanical coding work. Learn to combine systems thinking, product vision, design sensibility, and strategic judgment while AI agents handle implementation details.

**Key Promise:** Use proven patterns from battle-tested CTO experience to go from idea to production in 6 weeks.

## Book Structure

**Part 1: Foundations** - Core concepts including the Renaissance Developer mindset, what agentic coding is, architecture principles for AI-friendly systems, digestible interfaces, and understanding new bottlenecks when coding accelerates 5-10x.

**Part 2: The Playbook** - Complete 6-week workflow from idea to production: brainstorming, product brief, requirements in EARS notation, technical design, implementation planning, testing strategies, deployment pipelines, environment progression, managing AI agents, and post-MVP iteration.

**Part 3: Patterns & Tools** - Reusable patterns and tools including architecture patterns, specification patterns (EARS, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI), testing strategies for AI-generated code, and the agentic development toolchain (MCP servers, Claude Code skills, code review patterns).

**Part 4: Complete Example** - Real 6-week project documented end-to-end demonstrating all patterns and validating the timeline with actual code, decisions, and lessons learned.
