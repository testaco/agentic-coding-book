# OpenAPI for REST APIs

**Status**: This section is planned for Part 3 (Patterns & Tools).

For now, see [Interface Boundaries](../../part1-foundations/03-architecture-principles/04-interface-boundaries.md) for an introduction to OpenAPI specifications in agentic development.

Detailed patterns and examples will be added in the Part 3 implementation phase.
