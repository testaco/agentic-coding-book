## Part 1: Foundations

This part establishes the mindset and mental models you need for agentic development.

### Chapters

1. **[The Renaissance Developer](01-renaissance-developer/01-introduction-the-specialist-s-dilemma.md)** - The shift from deep specialization to strategic breadth
2. **[What is Agentic Coding](02-what-is-agentic-coding/01-introduction.md)** - Comprehensive definition covering tools, agents, and workflows
3. **[Architecture Principles](03-architecture-principles/01-introduction.md)** - System design optimized for AI-assisted implementation
4. **[Digestible Interfaces](04-digestible-interfaces/01-introduction.md)** - Why clear boundaries matter for both humans and AI
5. **[New Bottlenecks](05-new-bottlenecks/01-introduction.md)** - What becomes the constraint when coding accelerates 5-10x

### Reading Time

Estimated 2-3 hours for all chapters.

### Prerequisites

None. This is the starting point.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of Part 1, you'll understand:

- **The Renaissance Developer mindset**: Why breadth beats depth in the AI era, and how to become "good enough at everything"
- **What agentic coding encompasses**: The spectrum from AI pair programming to autonomous agents, and when to use each approach
- **Architecture principles for AI**: Component decomposition, interface boundaries, separation of concerns, and testability strategies optimized for AI-assisted development
- **Digestible interfaces**: How to design interfaces that both humans and AI can work with effectively, understanding cognitive and context window constraints
- **New bottlenecks**: Where constraints shift when coding accelerates 5-10x (requirements, product decisions, architecture, code review, testing)

### Chapter Overview

#### Chapter 1: The Renaissance Developer

**Sections**: 10 | **Diagrams**: 7 | **Reading time**: ~30 minutes

Introduces the Renaissance Developer model—the shift from deep specialization to strategic breadth. Explores Werner Vogels' concept of being "good enough at everything" and how agentic coding enables a single developer to handle product, design, engineering, and operations.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Deep specialization is becoming less valuable than broad competency
- AI agents fill skill gaps, enabling individuals to ship complete products
- The mindset shift from "perfect code" to "shipped product"

#### Chapter 2: What is Agentic Coding?

**Sections**: 10 | **Diagrams**: 3 | **Reading time**: ~25 minutes

Defines agentic coding comprehensively, covering the spectrum from AI pair programming tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to autonomous agents and natural language workflows. Clarifies what agentic coding is and importantly, what it is NOT.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Agentic coding is a spectrum, not a single tool or technique
- Different approaches for different use cases and skill levels
- Practical example of building a REST API with AI assistance

#### Chapter 3: Architecture Principles for Agentic Development

**Sections**: 10 | **Diagrams**: 8 | **Reading time**: ~35 minutes

First principles of software architecture optimized for AI-assisted development. Covers the digestibility principle, component decomposition, interface boundaries, separation of concerns, and testability patterns that work well with AI agents.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Architecture should be optimized for AI context windows and human cognitive limits
- Clear interfaces and bounded components enable parallel AI work
- Testability becomes even more critical with AI-generated code

#### Chapter 4: Digestible Interfaces

**Sections**: 10 | **Diagrams**: 6 | **Reading time**: ~30 minutes

Deep dive into why digestible interfaces matter for both humans and AI agents. Explores human cognitive constraints (working memory ~7 items) and AI constraints (context windows), showing how the same design principles serve both.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Human working memory and AI context windows have similar constraints
- Good interface design serves both humans and AI equally well
- Metrics for measuring interface digestibility

#### Chapter 5: New Bottlenecks

**Sections**: 10 | **Diagrams**: 13 | **Reading time**: ~40 minutes

Identifies the new constraints when coding accelerates 5-10x through agentic tools. Covers five major bottlenecks: requirements clarity, product decisions, architecture/design, code review at scale, and testing/QA velocity. Provides mitigation strategies for each.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Implementation is no longer the constraint—clarity is
- Requirements and business vision become the new bottleneck
- Solutions exist but require organizational and process adaptation

### How to Read This Part

**Linear Reading (Recommended)**:
Start with Chapter 1 and proceed sequentially. Each chapter builds on concepts from previous chapters.

**Targeted Reading**:

- **Non-technical readers**: Focus on Chapters 1, 2, and 5
- **Developers**: Skim Chapter 1, deep-dive Chapters 3-4
- **Leaders/CTOs**: Read Chapters 1, 5 in full; skim 2-4 for context

### Next Steps

After completing Part 1, proceed to [Part 2: The Playbook](../part2-playbook/README.md) to learn the concrete 6-week workflow from idea to production.
