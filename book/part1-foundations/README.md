## Part 1: Foundations

This part establishes the mindset and mental models you need for agentic development.

### Chapters

1. [The Renaissance Developer](01-renaissance-developer/01-introduction-the-specialist-s-dilemma.md) - The shift from deep specialization to strategic breadth
2. What is Agentic Coding - Comprehensive definition covering tools, agents, and workflows *(coming soon)*
3. Architecture Principles - System design optimized for AI-assisted implementation *(coming soon)*
4. Digestible Interfaces - Why clear boundaries matter for both humans and AI *(coming soon)*
5. New Bottlenecks - What becomes the constraint when coding accelerates 5-10x *(coming soon)*

### Reading Time

Estimated 2-3 hours for all chapters.

### Prerequisites

None. This is the starting point.

### What You'll Learn

- The Renaissance Developer mindset and why breadth beats depth in the AI era
- What agentic coding encompasses (tools, agents, workflows)
- Architecture principles that work well with AI-assisted development
- How to design interfaces that both humans and AI can work with effectively
- Where the new bottlenecks are when implementation becomes fast
