# Introduction: The Acceleration Paradox

[Placeholder: Hook the reader with a relatable scenario showing the paradox.

Example opening: "Your AI agent just generated 500 lines of perfectly functional code in 3 minutes.
You're elated—until you realize you're not sure if it's building the right thing. You spend the next
2 hours rewriting requirements and explaining what you actually meant. Welcome to the acceleration paradox."

Establish the central insight: When coding becomes radically faster through AI agents, the bottlenecks
don't disappear—they shift. What was once the slow part (implementation) becomes fast, exposing
everything upstream and downstream as the new constraints.

3-5 paragraphs introducing:

- The promise: 5-10x coding acceleration with AI agents
- The surprise: New bottlenecks emerge in unexpected places
- The challenge: Adapting your workflow to these new constraints
- The opportunity: Mastering these bottlenecks unlocks sustainable velocity]

**In this chapter, we'll explore**:

- How agentic coding fundamentally changes where time is spent
- The five major bottlenecks that emerge when implementation accelerates
- Why traditional development practices break down at this velocity
- Practical strategies for identifying and addressing these new constraints
- How to maintain momentum throughout the entire product lifecycle
