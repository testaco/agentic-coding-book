# Human Constraints: Working Memory Limits

[Placeholder: Detailed explanation of human cognitive limitations and how they affect
interface design.

Cover the psychology:
- **Working memory**: 7±2 items (Miller's Law)
- **Cognitive load theory**: Intrinsic vs. extraneous vs. germane load
- **Attention limits**: Multitasking myths and focus fragmentation
- **Chunking**: How experts group information to overcome limits

Show how these constraints manifest in software development:
- Reading code with too many variables in scope
- Functions with 10+ parameters that are hard to call correctly
- Configuration files requiring constant cross-referencing
- APIs where understanding one method requires understanding 5 others

Use concrete examples from real codebases (anonymized if needed).

~3-5 pages with diagrams showing cognitive overload scenarios.]

## The Cost of Exceeding Limits

[Placeholder: What happens when interfaces exceed working memory?
- Errors and bugs from incorrect usage
- Constant context switching to documentation
- Slower development velocity
- Difficulty onboarding new team members]

## How Developers Cope

[Placeholder: Strategies developers use (often unconsciously) to deal with
complex interfaces:
- Note-taking and external memory aids
- Simplified mental models (sometimes incorrect)
- Relying on IDE autocomplete and type hints
- Copy-paste patterns without full understanding]
