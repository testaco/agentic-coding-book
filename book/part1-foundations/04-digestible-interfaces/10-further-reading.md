## Continuing Your Learning

[Placeholder: Suggested exercises for practicing digestible interface design:
1. Audit your current codebase for complex interfaces
2. Practice refactoring complex functions into digestible components
3. Test your interfaces with AI agents and observe where they struggle
4. Apply the metrics and tests from Section 8 to your own code]
