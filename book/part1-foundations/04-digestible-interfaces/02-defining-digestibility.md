# Defining Digestibility

[Placeholder: Deep dive into the concept of "digestibility" for interfaces.

Define it clearly: An interface is digestible when it can be fully understood and
used correctly without exceeding the cognitive or computational limits of the user
- whether that user is a human developer or an AI agent.

Explain the core characteristics:
- **Bounded complexity**: Limited number of parameters, options, or concepts
- **Clear purpose**: Single, well-defined responsibility
- **Self-contained**: Can be understood without consulting extensive external documentation
- **Predictable**: Behavior follows intuitive patterns
- **Composable**: Can be combined with other interfaces without cognitive overload

Use concrete metrics where possible (e.g., "7±2 items in working memory", "200K token context windows").

~3-5 pages establishing the foundation for the rest of the chapter.]

## The Digestibility Spectrum

[Placeholder: Not all interfaces need the same level of digestibility. Show the spectrum
from highly digestible (single-purpose, few parameters) to complex but necessary (configuration
with many options). Help readers understand where to aim based on use case.]

## Why "Digestible" vs. "Simple"

[Placeholder: Address the distinction - digestible doesn't mean oversimplified or feature-poor.
It means appropriately scoped and well-structured. A complex domain can have digestible interfaces
through proper decomposition.]
