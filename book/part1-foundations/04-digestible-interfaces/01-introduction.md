# Introduction: The Interface Problem

[Placeholder: Hook the reader with a relatable scenario showing interface complexity.
Perhaps a story of encountering an API with 47 parameters, or a function that does
too many things, or a configuration file that requires constant cross-referencing.

Establish why interface digestibility matters - it's not just about human convenience,
it's about making your system workable for both human maintainers AND AI agents.

3-5 paragraphs introducing the core problem: interfaces that are hard to understand,
hard to use correctly, and hard to explain - whether the "user" is a human or an AI.]

**In this chapter, we'll explore**:

- What makes an interface "digestible" for humans and AI agents
- The surprising parallels between working memory and context windows
- Why good interfaces serve both audiences simultaneously
- Practical principles for designing digestible interfaces
- Real-world examples of digestible vs. complex interfaces
