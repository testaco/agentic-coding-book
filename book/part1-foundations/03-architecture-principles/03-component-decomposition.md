[Placeholder: Explain how to decompose systems into components that AI agents can work with.
What makes a good component boundary? How small is too small? How large is too large?
Discuss vertical slicing, feature-based decomposition, and domain-driven design principles adapted for AI.
Show examples of component structures that work well vs. monolithic structures that don't.
~3-5 pages.]

**Decomposition strategies**:

- [Strategy 1: Vertical slicing by feature]
- [Strategy 2: Bounded contexts and domain boundaries]
- [Strategy 3: Interface segregation for AI agents]
- [Strategy 4: Dependency management and minimization]
