[Placeholder: What mistakes do people make when architecting systems for agentic development?
How to recognize and avoid them?
Based on real experiences and common misunderstandings.
Focus on architecture-specific pitfalls, not general coding mistakes.]

- **Pitfall 1: Over-Engineering for Perfect AI Digestion** - Trying to make everything perfectly sized for context windows leads to over-fragmentation and complexity. [Description and how to avoid]

- **Pitfall 2: Ignoring Human Readability** - Optimizing solely for AI at the expense of human understanding creates maintenance nightmares. [Description and how to avoid]

- **Pitfall 3: Under-Specifying Interfaces** - Assuming AI can infer implicit contracts leads to brittle, buggy implementations. [Description and how to avoid]

- **Pitfall 4: Premature Abstraction** - Creating elaborate abstraction layers before understanding the problem domain. [Description and how to avoid]

- **Pitfall 5: Neglecting Integration Points** - Focusing on individual components while ignoring how they connect and communicate. [Description and how to avoid]
