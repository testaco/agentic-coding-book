[Placeholder: Deep dive into the digestibility principle.
Define what it means for code to be "digestible" by AI agents - fitting in context windows, clear boundaries, minimal cognitive load.
Explain the parallel between human working memory constraints and AI context window constraints.
Use examples, analogies, and concrete scenarios showing digestible vs. non-digestible architectures.
~3-5 pages.]

**Key characteristics of digestible architecture**:

- [Characteristic 1: Size constraints and context windows]
- [Characteristic 2: Clear boundaries and separation of concerns]
- [Characteristic 3: Minimal dependencies and coupling]
- [Characteristic 4: Self-documenting structure]

[Additional subsections as needed for this principle]
