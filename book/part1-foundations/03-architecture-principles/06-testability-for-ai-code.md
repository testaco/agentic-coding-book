[Placeholder: Explain why testability is critical for agentic development.
When AI generates code, you need fast, reliable tests to validate correctness.
Architecture must enable easy testing - dependency injection, pure functions, mocked boundaries.
Show examples of testable vs. untestable architectures and their impact on AI development velocity.
~3-5 pages.]

**Testability principles**:

- [Principle 1: Dependency injection for mocking]
- [Principle 2: Pure functions and predictable behavior]
- [Principle 3: Test boundaries aligned with component boundaries]
- [Principle 4: Fast feedback loops]
