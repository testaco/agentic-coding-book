[Placeholder: Hook the reader with a relatable scenario showing how traditional architecture breaks down with AI agents.
Establish why architecture needs to be rethought for agentic development - not just "good architecture" but architecture specifically optimized for AI collaboration.
3-5 paragraphs max - this is just the intro, detailed principles come in later sections.]

**In this chapter, we'll explore**:

- Why traditional architecture patterns need adaptation for AI agents
- First principles that make codebases digestible for both humans and AI
- How to structure systems that AI agents can understand and modify
- Practical patterns for decomposition, boundaries, and interfaces
