[Placeholder: Explain separation of concerns specifically for AI agents.
Why AI agents need clear boundaries between business logic, data access, presentation, etc.
How tangled concerns make it impossible for AI to safely modify code without breaking things.
Show examples of well-separated vs. tangled architectures and their impact on AI effectiveness.
~3-5 pages.]

**Key separations for agentic development**:

- [Separation 1: Business logic from infrastructure]
- [Separation 2: Data models from API contracts]
- [Separation 3: Configuration from code]
- [Separation 4: Tests from implementation]
