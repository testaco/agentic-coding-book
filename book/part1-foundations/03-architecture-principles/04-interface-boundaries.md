[Placeholder: Deep dive into interface design for agentic development.
Why explicit interfaces matter more when AI agents are modifying code.
How specifications (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema) enable AI to understand and implement interfaces correctly.
Show examples of clear vs. implicit interfaces and their impact on AI code generation.
~3-5 pages.]

**Principles for clear interfaces**:

- [Principle 1: Explicit over implicit contracts]
- [Principle 2: Specification-driven development]
- [Principle 3: Type safety and validation]
- [Principle 4: Documentation as code]
