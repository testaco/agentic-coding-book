[Placeholder: Show how to apply the principles from previous sections in real scenarios.
Include concrete example with AI agents - architecting a complete feature or system.
Walk through decision-making process: how to decompose, where to draw boundaries, what interfaces to define.
Show the architecture evolution with Claude Code collaboration.]

## Example: Architecting a REST API with AI Agents

[Placeholder: Complete walkthrough demonstrating the architectural principles in action.
Show initial requirements, architecture decisions, component breakdown, interface definitions.
Include Mermaid diagrams showing system structure.
Demonstrate how this architecture enables effective AI collaboration.]
