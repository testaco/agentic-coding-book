  [Placeholder: Introduces the Renaissance Developer concept - the shift from deep
  specialization to broad competency across product, design, architecture, and business,
  enabled by AI agents handling implementation details.]

## Introduction: The Specialist's Dilemma

[Placeholder: Open with the traditional software career path - go deep in one area
(backend, frontend, DevOps, etc.). Explain why this made sense when coding was the bottleneck.
Then introduce the problem: when AI agents can handle implementation, what value does
deep specialization in coding provide? Hook: "You've spent years becoming an expert
React developer. Now Claude can write React better than you. What's your role?"]

## The Renaissance Developer Model

[Placeholder: Define the core concept - a polymath who is "good enough at everything"
to ship complete products. Not a 10x engineer, but a 1x product builder. Explain the
difference between depth (expert-level coding) vs breadth (product thinking + design +
architecture + business + technical literacy). Use the historical Renaissance person
analogy - Leonardo da Vinci wasn't the best painter OR sculptor OR engineer, but could
do all three well enough to create masterpieces.]

### From Code Executor to Product Orchestrator

[Placeholder: Explain the mindset shift - you're no longer writing most code yourself,
you're orchestrating AI agents to implement your vision. Your value is in the thinking:
What should we build? How should it work? Why these tradeoffs? Your job is product
strategy, architectural decisions, and quality judgment, not implementation.]

### The Five Competency Domains

[Placeholder: Break down the skill areas Renaissance Developers need. Not mastery,
but "good enough" literacy:]

#### 1. Product Thinking

[Placeholder: Understanding user needs, defining MVPs, prioritization frameworks,
knowing what to build and what to cut. You don't need an MBA, but you need to think
like a founder.]

#### 2. Systems Architecture

[Placeholder: High-level system design, component boundaries, data flow, API contracts.
You don't need to optimize algorithms, but you need to know when to use a queue vs
a cron job vs real-time websockets.]

#### 3. Design Sensibility

[Placeholder: UI/UX fundamentals, information architecture, understanding what makes
interfaces intuitive. You don't need to be a designer, but you need to recognize good
UX and communicate clearly with AI about what you want.]

#### 4. Technical Literacy

[Placeholder: Enough coding knowledge to read/review/debug AI-generated code, understand
technical tradeoffs, and guide AI agents effectively. You don't need to memorize APIs,
but you need to know what's possible and what's a bad idea.]

#### 5. Strategic Judgment

[Placeholder: When to ship vs iterate, technical debt tradeoffs, security/performance
considerations, knowing what "good enough" means for your context. This comes from
experience, not from AI.]

## What Changes, What Doesn't

[Placeholder: Create a comparison showing what AI handles vs what you still own.
Include specific examples:]

**What AI Handles Now:**
- Writing boilerplate code
- Implementing specs into code
- Writing tests
- Debugging syntax errors
- Researching API documentation
- Code formatting and style

**What You Still Own:**
- Deciding what to build (product vision)
- Defining how it should work (architecture)
- Writing clear specifications
- Making tradeoff decisions
- Reviewing and validating AI output
- Understanding the "why" behind choices

## The "Good Enough at Everything" Principle

[Placeholder: Explain this isn't about being mediocre - it's about optimal allocation
of learning effort. Depth in coding has diminishing returns when AI handles implementation.
Breadth across domains has compounding returns because it enables independent product
shipping. Use concrete example: knowing 80% of React + 80% of design + 80% of system
architecture is more valuable than knowing 100% of React when you have AI agents.]

## From Coder to Builder: A Mindset Shift

[Placeholder: Discuss the psychological shift required. Many developers derive identity
from technical mastery. Agentic coding requires shifting that identity to product
building and problem solving. Your craft becomes "orchestrating systems and AI to
solve user problems" rather than "writing elegant code." This can feel uncomfortable
but is ultimately more rewarding and impactful.]

## Practical Example: Building a Feature Alone

[Placeholder: Walk through a concrete scenario - "Add user authentication to an app."
Show two approaches:

**Traditional Specialist Approach:**
- Backend dev implements auth API (2 days)
- Frontend dev builds login UI (1 day)
- Designer creates mockups (1 day)
- DevOps sets up deployment (0.5 days)
- PM writes specs and coordinates (0.5 days)
- Total: 5 days, 5 people

**Renaissance Developer with AI:**
- You write product brief (what/why) (1 hour)
- You design rough UI wireframe (1 hour)
- You write auth spec in EARS notation (2 hours)
- Claude implements backend + frontend + tests (2 hours review/iteration)
- You deploy and validate (1 hour)
- Total: 1 day, 1 person

Show the difference isn't just speed - it's agency and ownership.]

## Common Pitfalls

[Placeholder: Address specific mistakes people make when transitioning:]

- **Pitfall 1: Trying to be an expert at everything**: You don't need mastery, you need
  literacy. Depth takes years; breadth takes weeks of focused learning per domain.

- **Pitfall 2: Abandoning technical skills entirely**: "Good enough" technical literacy
  is still essential. You can't orchestrate what you don't understand at a basic level.

- **Pitfall 3: Feeling like an impostor**: "I'm not a real designer/architect/PM" -
  correct, and that's the point. You're a builder who knows enough of each discipline
  to ship products. That's the new bar.

- **Pitfall 4: Trusting AI blindly**: Renaissance Developers need judgment to validate
  AI output. "Move fast" doesn't mean "ship without review."

- **Pitfall 5: Dismissing specialists**: You're not replacing expert designers or
  architects - you're handling projects/features where hiring specialists isn't viable
  (early MVPs, solo projects, small teams, rapid prototyping).

## Why This Matters Now

[Placeholder: Explain the timing - why Renaissance Developer is possible now but wasn't
5 years ago. Three converging factors:
1. AI agents can handle implementation reliably
2. Modern tooling is more accessible (cloud platforms, frameworks, deployment automation)
3. Market rewards speed-to-market over perfect code

This creates a window where generalists with AI can compete with specialist teams.
This chapter sets up the "what" - the rest of the book teaches the "how."]

## Summary

[Placeholder: Key takeaways - 4-5 bullets]

- The Renaissance Developer is a polymath who is "good enough at everything" to ship
  complete products independently, orchestrating AI agents for implementation
- Core competencies: Product thinking, systems architecture, design sensibility,
  technical literacy, strategic judgment
- Value shifts from coding mastery to product vision, architectural decisions, and
  quality validation
- This is enabled by AI handling implementation, modern tooling reducing complexity,
  and markets rewarding shipping speed
- You're not becoming a worse developer - you're becoming a complete product builder
