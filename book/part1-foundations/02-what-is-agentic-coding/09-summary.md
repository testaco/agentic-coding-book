abstract: Section 9 of What is Agentic Coding?
---

Let's recap the key concepts from this chapter:

- **Agentic coding encompasses five complementary categories**: AI pair programming (real-time assistance), autonomous agents (multi-step task execution), AI code review (quality enforcement), NL2Code (specification to implementation), and AI testing/debugging (automated validation). Each excels at specific tasks in the development lifecycle.

- **The fundamental shift is from executor to orchestrator**: You move from writing most code yourself to orchestrating AI agents that handle mechanical implementation while you focus on product vision, architecture, and strategic judgment. Your value shifts from execution speed to thinking quality.

- **These tools work together in powerful combinations**: Planning with autonomous agents, implementing with pair programming, validating with AI testing, and reviewing with AI code review creates a workflow that's 5-10x faster than traditional development while often improving quality through thoroughness.

- **Agentic coding accelerates development dramatically but requires clear requirements, critical review, and engineering judgment**: The better your specifications, the better your results. Always review AI-generated code, test thoroughly, and apply strategic thinking to ensure implementations meet actual needs.

- **Success requires the right mindset**: Think in outcomes rather than implementation steps, treat AI as a capable but junior collaborator needing clear specs and review, invest time in requirements clarity (it pays 10x dividends), and recognize that your value lies in the "what" and "why," not the "how."

The transition to agentic coding is profound but accessible. The tools are available now. The techniques work for teams of any size. The results—shipping 5-10x faster while maintaining or improving quality—are achievable with practice.

The challenge isn't technical capability; it's mental shift. Can you move from writing code to orchestrating code generation? Can you invest time in specifications rather than rushing to implementation? Can you review critically rather than trusting blindly?

These are learnable skills. The next chapters will give you the frameworks, patterns, and examples to develop them systematically.
