This chapter defined what agentic coding is and how it transforms development. The following chapters build on this foundation:

- **Previous**: [The Renaissance Developer](../01-renaissance-developer/01-introduction-the-specialist-s-dilemma.md) - The mindset foundation that makes agentic coding effective. Understanding the Renaissance Developer model—being "good enough at everything"—is crucial context for why agentic coding matters.

- **Next**: Architecture Principles for Agentic Development (coming soon) - How to design systems that work well with AI agents. The architecture patterns that make agentic coding smooth versus frustrating.

- **Part 2**: Managing AI Agents (coming soon) - Practical strategies for working effectively with AI tools. Detailed prompting techniques, collaboration patterns, and troubleshooting guidance.

- **Part 3**: MCP Servers (coming soon) - Extending AI capabilities with the Model Context Protocol. How to add custom tools and capabilities to AI agents for your specific needs.

- **Part 3**: Skills and Custom Tools (coming soon) - Creating specialized AI capabilities for your workflow. Building reusable patterns that accelerate common tasks.
