**Part 1: Foundations** is live and ready to read:

👉 [Start Reading Part 1](https://testaco.github.io/agentic-coding-book)

You'll learn:
- The **Renaissance Developer** mindset (breadth over depth)
- What **agentic coding** actually means (beyond the hype)
- **Architecture principles** for AI-friendly code
- The **Digestibility Principle** (why humans and AI have the same constraints)
- The **5 new bottlenecks** when coding gets 5-10x faster

## What's coming

- **Part 2: The Playbook** — The complete 6-week journey from idea to production
- **Part 3: Patterns & Tools** — Architecture patterns, testing strategies, and the agent-friendly toolchain
- **Part 4: Complete Example** — A real, non-trivial product built using the entire playbook

I'll only email when there's something worth your time—no spam, no fluff.

**The meta story:** This book was built using its own methodology. The planning docs are public. The git history shows the process. It's proof that this approach works.

Thanks for being here.
